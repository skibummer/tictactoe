Tic-tac-toe

Welcome to my text based version of a tic-tac-toe game coded in python 3 and designed to run from a command line.

It prints a tic-tac-toe grid and allows for two human players to make choices by entering coordinates,
one integer at a time.
Players take turns until either someone wins or there is a tie.
This allows for rematches as well as allowing a player to try again if they input integers outside of the game range.

You'll need to download python 3.10.7

Enter the following into your preferred shell to get started.

"py main.py"

note: If you try "python main.py", make sure the PATH is setup.
If you don't want to go into the path environment/system variables manually, you can simply
reinstall python and enable the PATH for python.
